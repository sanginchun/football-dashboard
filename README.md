## Description
- Football dashboard is a single-page application that shows up-to-date information about football leagues and teams.
- Used [SportDataApi](https://app.sportdataapi.com/) which is not a public api, so error might occur due to the request limit.
- Made as a personal project to improve basic HTML, CSS, VanillaJS skills.
